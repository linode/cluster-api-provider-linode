# Cluster Object Store

The Cluster Object Store is an optional setting in the `LinodeCluster` resource definition that references an object
storage bucket used for internal cluster operations. Currently, the Cluster Object Store feature enables the following
capabilities:

- Bypassing bootstrap data limits during Linode provisioning

A [Linode Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/platform/object-storage/) bucket and access key are
provisioned as the Cluster Object Store for each `LinodeCluster` resource with any of the `*-full` flavors. BYOB (Bring
Your Own Bucket) may be used instead, by modifying a `LinodeCluster` definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: LinodeCluster
metadata:
name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
spec:
  objectStore:
    credentialsRef:
      name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-object-store-credentials
```

to reference any Secret containing a object storage bucket's credentials in the following format:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-object-store-credentials
data:
  bucket_name: ${BUCKET_NAME}
  # Service endpoint
  # See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html
  s3_endpoint: ${S3_ENDPOINT}
  access_key: ${ACCESS_KEY}
  secret_key: ${SECRET_KEY}
```

### Bootstrap Data Limits During Linode Provisioning

Currently, during `LinodeMachine` bootstrapping, CAPL delivers the bootstrap data generated by a [bootstrap
provider](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/glossary.html?highlight=bootstrap#bootstrap-provider) to it's
infrastructure Linode via one of the following services:

| Service                                                                                       | Bootstrap Data Limit                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Metadata](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/overview-of-the-metadata-service) | [65535 bytes](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance)       |
| [Stackscripts](https://www.linode.com/products/stackscripts/)                                 | [65,535 characters](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance) |

These data limits are bypassed when the Cluster Object Store feature is enabled.
