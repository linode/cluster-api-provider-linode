# Firewalling

This guide covers how Cilium can be set up to act as a [host firewall](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/host-firewall/) on CAPL clusters.

## Default Configuration
By default, the following policies are set to audit mode(without any enforcement) on CAPL clusters

* [Kubeadm](./flavors/default.md) cluster allow rules

    | Ports     | Use-case                 | Allowed clients       |
    |-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
    | 6443      | API Server Traffic       | World                 |
    | *         | In Cluster Communication | Intra Cluster Traffic |

```admonish note
For kubeadm clusters running outside of VPC, ports 2379 and 2380 are also allowed for etcd-traffic.
```

* [k3s](./flavors/k3s.md) cluster allow rules
    
    | Ports | Use-case                 | Allowed clients               |
    |-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
    | 6443  | API Server Traffic       | World                         |
    | *     | In Cluster Communication | Intra Cluster and VPC Traffic |

* [RKE2](./flavors/rke2.md) cluster allow rules

  | Ports | Use-case                 | Allowed clients               |
  |-------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
  | 6443  | API Server Traffic       | World                         |
  | *     | In Cluster Communication | Intra Cluster and VPC Traffic |

## Enabling Firewall Enforcement
In order to turn the cilium network policy from audit to enforce mode use the environment variable `FW_AUDIT_ONLY=false`
when generating the cluster. This will set the [policy-audit-mode](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy-creation/#creating-policies-from-verdicts)
on the cilium deployment

##  Adding Additional Rules
Additional rules can be added to the `default-policy`
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "default-external-policy"
spec:
  description: "allow cluster intra cluster traffic along api server traffic"
  nodeSelector: {}
  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
        - cluster
    - fromCIDR:
        - 10.0.0.0/8
    - fromEntities:
        - world
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "22" # added for SSH Access to the nodes
            - port: "6443"
```
Alternatively, additional rules can be added by creating a new policy
```yaml
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "ssh-access-policy"
spec:
  description: "allows ssh access to nodes"
  nodeSelector: {}
  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
        - world
      toPorts:
        - ports:
            - port: "22"
```
