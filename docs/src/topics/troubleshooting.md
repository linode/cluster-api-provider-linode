# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues users might run into when using Cluster API Provider Linode.
This list is work-in-progress, please feel free to open a PR to add this guide if you find
that useful information is missing.

## Examples of common issues

### No Linode resources are getting created

This could be due to the `LINODE_TOKEN` either not being set in your environment or expired.
If expired, [provision a new token](../topics/getting-started.md#prerequisites) and optionally
set the "Expiry" to "Never" (default expiry is 6 months).

### One or more control plane replicas are missing

Take a look at the `KubeadmControlPlane` controller logs and look for any potential errors:

```bash
kubectl logs deploy/capi-kubeadm-control-plane-controller-manager -n capi-kubeadm-control-plane-system manager
```

In addition, make sure all pods on the workload cluster are healthy, including pods in the `kube-system` namespace.

Otherwise, [ensure that the linode-ccm is installed on your workload cluster via CAAPH](../topics/addons.md#ccm).

### Nodes are in NotReady state

Make sure [a CNI is installed on the workload cluster](../topics/addons.md#cni)
and that all the pods on the workload cluster are in running state. 

If the Cluster is labeled with `cni: cilium`, check that the cilium `HelmChartProxy` is installed in
the management cluster and that the `HelmChartProxy` is in a `Ready` state:

```bash
kubectl get cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --show-labels
```

```bash
kubectl get helmchartproxies
```

## Checking CAPI and CAPL resources

To check the progression of all CAPI and CAPL resources on the management cluster you can run:

```bash
kubectl get cluster-api
```

## Looking at the CAPL controller logs

To check the CAPL controller logs on the management cluster, run:

```bash
kubectl logs deploy/cluster-api-provider-linode-controller-manager -n cluster-api-provider-linode-system manager
```

### Checking cloud-init logs (Debian / Ubuntu)

[Cloud-init](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/applications/configuration-management/cloud-init/)
logs can provide more information on any issues that happened when running the bootstrap script.

```admonish warning
Not all Debian and Ubuntu images available from Linode support cloud-init! Please see the
[Availability section of the Linode Metadata Service Guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/#availability).

You can also see which images have cloud-init support via the [linode-cli](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/):

`linode-cli images list | grep cloud-init`

```

Please refer to the [Troubleshoot Metadata and Cloud-Init section of the Linode Metadata Service Guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/?tabs=linode-api%2Cmacos#troubleshoot-metadata-and-cloud-init).
