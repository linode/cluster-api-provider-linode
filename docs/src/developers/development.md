## Setting up

### Base requirements

```admonish warning
Ensure you have your `LINODE_TOKEN` set as outlined in the 
[getting started prerequisites](../topics/getting-started.md#Prerequisites) section.
```

There are no requirements since development dependencies are fetched as
needed via the make targets, but a recommendation is to
[install Devbox](https://jetpack.io/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/)

### Clone the source code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/linode/cluster-api-provider-linode
cd cluster-api-provider-linode
```

### Enable git hooks

To enable automatic code validation on code push, execute the following commands:

```sh
PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" make husky && husky install
```

If you would like to temporarily disable git hook, set `SKIP_GIT_PUSH_HOOK` value:

```sh
SKIP_GIT_PUSH_HOOK=1 git push
```

### [Recommended] Set up devbox

1. Install dependent packages in your project
   ```sh
   devbox install
   ```

   ```admonish success title=""
   This will take a while, go and grab a drink of water.
   ```

2. Use devbox environment
   ```sh
   devbox shell
   ```

From this point you can use the devbox shell like a regular shell.
The rest of the guide assumes a devbox shell is used, but the make target
dependencies will install any missing dependencies if needed when running
outside a devbox shell.

### Get familiar with basic concepts

This provider is based on the [Cluster API project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api).
It's recommended to familiarize yourself with Cluster API resources, concepts, and conventions
outlined in the [Cluster API Book](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

## Developing

This repository uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
to track and vendor dependencies.

To pin a new dependency, run:
```sh
go get <repository>@<version>
```


### Using tilt
To build a kind cluster and start Tilt, simply run:
```sh
make tilt-cluster
```

Once your kind management cluster is up and running, you can
[deploy a workload cluster](#deploying-a-workload-cluster).

To tear down the tilt-cluster, run

```sh
kind delete cluster --name tilt
```

### Deploying a workload cluster

After your kind management cluster is up and running with Tilt, you should be ready to deploy your first cluster.

#### Generating the cluster templates

For local development, templates should be generated via:

```sh
make local-release
```

This creates `infrastructure-linode/0.0.0/` with all the cluster templates:

```sh
infrastructure-linode/0.0.0
├── cluster-template-kubeadm-clusterclass.yaml
├── cluster-template.yaml
├── infrastructure-components.yaml
└── metadata.yaml
```

This can then be used with `clusterctl` by adding the following to `~/.clusterctl/cluster-api.yaml`
(assuming the repo exists in the `$HOME` directory):

```
providers:
  - name: linode
    url: ${HOME}/cluster-api-provider-linode/infrastructure-linode/0.0.0/infrastructure-components.yaml
    type: InfrastructureProvider
```

#### Customizing the cluster deployment

Here is a list of required configuration parameters:

```sh
# Cluster settings
export CLUSTER_NAME=capl-cluster
export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.29.1

# Linode settings
export LINODE_REGION=us-ord
export LINODE_TOKEN=<your linode PAT>
export LINODE_CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_TYPE=g6-standard-2
export LINODE_MACHINE_TYPE=g6-standard-2
```

~~~admonish tip
You can also use `clusterctl generate` to see which variables need to be set:

```
clusterctl generate cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --infrastructure linode:0.0.0 [--flavor <flavor>] --list-variables
```

~~~

#### Creating the workload cluster

##### Using the default flavor

Once you have all the necessary environment variables set,
you can deploy a workload cluster with the default flavor:

```sh
clusterctl generate cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --kubernetes-version v1.29.1 \
  --infrastructure linode:0.0.0 \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will provision the cluster with the CNI defaulted to [cilium](../topics/addons.md#cilium)
and the [linode-ccm](../topics/addons.md#ccm) installed.

##### Using ClusterClass (alpha)

~~~admonish success title=""
ClusterClass experimental feature is enabled by default in the KIND management cluster
created via `make tilt-cluster`
~~~

You can use the `clusterclass` flavor to create a workload cluster as well, assuming the
management cluster has the [ClusterTopology feature gate set](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/cluster-class/):

```sh
clusterctl generate cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --kubernetes-version v1.29.1 \
  --infrastructure linode:0.0.0 \
  --flavor kubeadm-clusterclass \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

```admonish question title=""
For any issues, please refer to the [troubleshooting guide](../topics/troubleshooting.md).
```

#### Cleaning up the workload cluster

To delete the cluster, simply run:

```sh
kubectl delete cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
```

```admonish question title=""
For any issues, please refer to the [troubleshooting guide](../topics/troubleshooting.md).
```

### Automated Testing

#### E2E Testing

To run E2E locally run:
```sh
make e2etest
```

This command creates a KIND cluster, and executes all the defined tests.

```admonish warning
Please ensure you have [increased maximum open files on your host](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files)
```
