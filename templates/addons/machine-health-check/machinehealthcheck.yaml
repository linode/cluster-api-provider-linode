  # (Optional) maxUnhealthy prevents further remediation if the cluster is already partially unhealthy
  maxUnhealthy: 40%
  # (Optional) nodeStartupTimeout determines how long a MachineHealthCheck should wait for
  # a Node to join the cluster, before considering a Machine unhealthy.
  # Defaults to 10 minutes if not specified.
  # Set to 0 to disable the node startup timeout.
  # Disabling this timeout will prevent a Machine from being considered unhealthy when
  # the Node it created has not yet registered with the cluster. This can be useful when
  # Nodes take a long time to start up or when you only want condition based checks for
  # Machine health.
  nodeStartupTimeout: 10m
  # Conditions to check on Nodes for matched Machines, if any condition is matched for the duration of its timeout, the Machine is considered unhealthy
