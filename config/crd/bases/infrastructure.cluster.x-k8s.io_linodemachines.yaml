                  This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller
                  faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of
                  the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the
                  responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.


                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the
                  controller's output.
